# Elevator Exercise

## Assignment
Write an application in C# that will control an elevator. This application should maintain
the state of the elevator position, movement, the doors, as well as respond to the
controls inside and out while simulating the elevator operation.

There are five floors. The first and fifth floors have a call button to bring the elevator to
that floor. The second, third and fourth floor have up/down buttons that call the
elevator to the floor.

Inside the elevator there are five buttons representing each of the floors. For simplicity
there are no other buttons. For example, there are no buttons for emergency stop,
open door, or close door. Furthermore we can omit any other mechanisms such as door
sensors.

This application should demonstrate the following.
1. Good object oriented design
2. Readable code
3. Automated Testing (you may choose Nunit, MStest/vstest, xunit, â€¦)
   You may make any kind of application that you choose (Web, Console, and GUI) so long
   as internally it demonstrates the above requirements.
